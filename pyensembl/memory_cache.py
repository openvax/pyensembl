"""
Cache and serializing the results of expensive computations. Used in pyensembl
primarily to cache the heavy-weight parsing of GTF files and various
filtering operations on Ensembl entries.

A piece of data is returned from one of three sources:
1) Cache cold. Run the user-supplied compute_fn.
2) Cache warm on disk. Parse or unpickle the serialized result into memory.
3) Cache warm in memory. Return cached object.
