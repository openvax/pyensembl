        We're not counting immunoglobulin-like genes from the T-cell receptor or
        or antibodies since they occur in fragments that must be recombined.
        It might be worth consider counting non-sense mediated decay and
        non-stop decay since variants in these could potentially make a
        functional protein. To read more about the biotypes used in Ensembl:
